These are patches for the Gentoo KVM package.  They're too big to fit in
FILESDIR anymore, so this repo tracks them for a tarball on mirrors.

They are in the required format to bulk applied by epatch:

<num>_<arch>_<name>.patch

where

<num> is the order number (01-99)
<arch> is the gentoo arch to apply it to (all for every arch)
<name> is the name of the patch
